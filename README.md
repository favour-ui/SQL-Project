# SQL Project

This repository contains all my completed SQL projects.

All tasks here were completed using Mysql, but you can easily adapt them to other SQL databases such as PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL Server, Azure SQL, and more.

 - ⚠**Note:** If you use a database other than PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server, some SQL functions may differ. Always confirm that you’re using the correct syntax and function names for your chosen database.

Here are the projects you will find in this repository:
