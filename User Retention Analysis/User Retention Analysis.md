# User Retention Analysis

## CONTEXT
On February 20, 2025, Colume introduced three new features â€” Task Reminders, Voice Assistant, and Custom Themes. The product team wants to understand how these features influence user behavior, particularly their impact on retention and long-term engagement.

## PROBLEM
We need to evaluate whether users who adopted these features within the first 7 days of launch show higher weekly retention compared to those who did not. This analysis will reveal if early feature adoption directly improves stickiness and sustained engagement, guiding future feature rollouts and engagement strategies.

### Who are the stakeholders
Stakeholder: Product Team

## BUSINESS IMPACT

The analysis reveals that feature adopters retain nearly twice as much as non-adopters (78% vs. 40% by Week 9). This shows that the new features significantly increase user stickiness and long-term engagement.

By driving more users toward adopting features like Task Reminders or Voice Assistant, Colume can:

 - **Reduce churn rates:** directly increasing customer lifetime value (CLV).

 - **Boost active user base:** ensuring stronger daily/weekly engagement metrics.

 - **Improve ROI of feature development:** showing clear evidence that product innovations lead to measurable retention gains.
